# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
PyBer is a ride share app and with the help of my Python skills utiliing Pandas and Matplotlib on the Jupyter Notebook platform i have created this DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, a multiple-line graph is illustrated here that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  The represented data will delineate the following details
1. How the data differs by city type and 
2. How those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer

The analysis is based on the following points among the different city types:

1.	Total rides,
2.	Total drivers,
3.	Total fares,
4.	Average fare per ride and driver,
5.	Total fare by city type.

## Resources
•	Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
•	Software: Python , Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook 

## Results: Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
### Ride-sharing data -

### 1.	Total rides
Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities

68% of total rides were in Urban setting

### 2.	Total drivers
There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities

86% of total drivers were in Urban setting

### 3.	Total fares
The total fares are higher in Urban than suburban and rural cities. PyBer transactions in urban cities totaled nearly $40,000 whereas transactions in suburban and rural cities were $19,000 and $4,000, respectively.
This is as a result of the higher use of the app in Urban setting rather in the remainder 2 city types.

### 4.	Average fare per ride and driver
The ride sharing data illustrates an inversely proportional relationship between the 3 different types of cities
1.	Urban cities have more rides and lower fares. The average fare is $25.
2.	Rural cities see less rides while fares are nearly $35. this makes the average fare in urban setting $10 cheaper than rural.
3.	An average fare for a ride in Suburban cities is around $31.
4.	Rural market is neither good for company- lesser rides nor good for consumers – higher fares.

### 5.	Total fare by city type.
The trend of total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities between January 2019 and April 2019 is seen in the image below. The gold-colored trend shows fares in urban cities ranging between$1,600 to $2,500 during the five-month analysis period. The sky-blue colored line graph shows how fares in rural cities ranging between $200 to $500. The coral-colored line graph shows how the total fares in suburban cities range in between the fares of urban and rural cities: around $600 to $1,300. The Peaks and troughs are great indicative of times when business was doing well {peak} and poor {troughs}.

The urban weekly total fare is 9 times higher than rural and about 2.25 times higher than suburban cities.

# Summary

Business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

•	PyBer sees a high revenue flow in Urban Cities with cheaper rides attracting more clientele necessitating higher driver use.

•	Rural setting sees a loss of revenue for the app with costs being higher to operate causing an undue burden on clients with them paying higher fares ~$10 higher than Urban cities. This could discourage potential drivers from working with PyBer as well as clients from using the service. 

•	Drivers could seek opportunities in urban cities for better salary causing a saturation in driver employment in Urban cities versus a deficit among rural cities.

•	Suburban settings have a potential of becoming a booming business with fares being just slightly higher and the client flow similar to urban setting. Improving drivers and availability can see a better revenue generation in future for the CEO to look at.

•	PyBer rider sharing services significantly differs in rural, suburban, and urban cities given the number of rides, drivers, and fares

•	Further analysis is necessary in order to determine other factors that could be contributing to the high ride costs in rural cities and low fares in urban cities; like socioeconomic factors, cultural bias, travel distance, ease of access etc.
