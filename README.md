# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
PyBer is a ride share app and with the help of my Python skills utiliing Pandas and Matplotlib on the Jupyter Notebook platform i have created this DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, a multiple-line graph is illustrated here that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  The represented data will delineate the following details
1. How the data differs by city type and 
2. How those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer

The analysis is based on the following points among the different city types:

1.	Total rides,
2.	Total drivers,
3.	Total fares,
4.	Average fare per ride and driver,
5.	Total fare by city type.

## Resources
•	Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
•	Software: Python , Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook 

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
### Ride-sharing data -

1.	Total rides
