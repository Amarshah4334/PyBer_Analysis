# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
PyBer is a ride share app and with the help of my Python skills utiliing Pandas and Matplotlib on the Jupyter Notebook platform i have created this DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, a multiple-line graph is illustrated here that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  The represented data will delineate the following details
1. How the data differs by city type and 
2. How those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer

The analysis is based on the following points among the different city types:

1.	Total rides,
2.	Total drivers,
3.	Total fares,
4.	Average fare per ride and driver,
5.	Total fare by city type.

## Resources
•	Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
•	Software: Python , Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook 

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
### Ride-sharing data -

### 1.	Total rides
Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities

68% of total rides were in Urban setting

### 2.	Total drivers
There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities

86% of total drivers were in Urban setting

### 3.	Total fares
The total fares are higher in Urban than suburban and rural cities. PyBer transactions in urban cities totaled nearly $40,000 whereas transactions in suburban and rural cities were $19,000 and $4,000, respectively.
This is as a result of the higher use of the facility in Urban setting rather in the remainder 2 city types.
